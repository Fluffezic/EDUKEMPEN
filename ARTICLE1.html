            <h2>Syrian kids dance with joy after being placed in same hotel as Furries</h2>
            <img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/10/16/dance1.jpg?quality=75&width=640&auto=webp" alt="Article 1 Image">
            <p>It was a case of simple good fortune. Mixed with a decent dash of humanity.

The organisers of the VancouFur festival - an event where people dress up as furry animal personas - had not planned to interact with the Syrian refugees who were staying at the same hotel.

Indeed, they warned those attending the event in Vancouver that the sight of fun-loving friendly costumes might even be upsetting for the youngsters. They warned those taking part in a letter that the convention would likely be “a major culture shock” and asked attendees to make the children feel welcome and safe.
But as a barrage of happy, smiling images have proved, there was no such problem after all.

Indeed, the youngsters, who were being put up at the Executive Airport Plaza as they prepare for new lives in Canada, were delighted by the “Furries” and the youngsters spent time dancing, laughing and jumping up and down in joy.
One of the Furries taking part, who uses the name Aphinity, filmed the scenes and said on Twitter: “Syrians interacting with costumed characters at @Vancoufur this year. I actually cried watching this as I filmed it.”

Speaking to The Independent from his home in Vancouver, Aphinity said the interaction with the children had been genuinely moving. He said he doubted the youngsters had ever seen anything like it.</p>
            <div class="quote-bubble">
                “This is what the fandom is capable of! Keep up the awesome!,”
            </div>
            <p>Chris Jantz, who has attended the festival for three years, told the New York Daily News that he and others at the fifth VancouFur convention were at their hotel on Sunday morning when a bus pulled up and dozens of refugees poured into the lobby.

“They saw people in giant animal costumes. To the children they were just cartoons from stuff like Yo Gabba Gabba!, etc., and they wanted to say hi,” he said. “I don’t think they had any concept of the furry fandom.”</p>
